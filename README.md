## Introduction

This module provides a skeleton for a new Magento 2 Module. It comes with examples, best practice advices and useful 
templates for documentation, specification or testing. 

If you think, you have alternative methods or another way of thinking, please feel free to contribute to this skeleton.

This Skeleton tries to cover several aspects:

* Quality of Code
* Legal Advices and Licenses
* Templates for Specification and Documentation
* Basic Setup for Tests
* Tools to get up and running

## About this README

The README is the first step to a good documentation. This file will be used by Github / Gitlab as a homepage and every
developer will know, that there might be some useful information about the code and the structure.

The README File can contain the whole documentation, but if a module is getting bigger and bigger, it might be handy to 
use a new directory. We call it ```doc```. Due to that, we will continue this documentation in the given directory.

## Quality of Code
